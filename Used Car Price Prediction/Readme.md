## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of cars based on various features, such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. The project is divided into several key components:

- **Data Collection:** The project involves the collection of a dataset that contains information about various cars, including their attributes and corresponding prices.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing is performed to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for training machine learning models. This step involves handling missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization.

- **Model Development:** Different machine learning algorithms are explored to build a predictive model. Techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks may be used.

- **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared. Cross-validation is also performed to ensure the model's robustness.

- **Deployment:** If applicable, the trained model can be deployed for use in real-world applications.

## Data

The data used in this project is not included in this repository due to its size. You can provide your own dataset or find a suitable dataset from sources like Kaggle or online automotive marketplaces.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries and packages:
