## About
This project is a simple implementation of a machine learning classifier for Iris flowers. It is intended as a beginner-friendly example of a classification task using the popular Iris dataset.

Iris flower classification is a classic problem in the field of machine learning. The dataset contains measurements of four features from three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). The goal is to build a model that can classify these flowers into their correct species based on these features.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset used in this project is included in popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. You can find it [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#iris-dataset). The dataset consists of 150 samples, 50 from each of the three species. There are four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) that were measured in centimeters.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LookOutForMe/Data-Science-Projects
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd "Iris Flower Classification"
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the model and classify Iris flowers.

2. You can customize the model, hyperparameters, or evaluation metrics as needed for your own experimentation.

## Results
Include the results of your classification model. You can showcase metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix. You may also provide visualizations if they help in understanding the results better.
